    Security is a complicated topic and itâ€™s important to stay up-to-date on the latest security trends
    during development of any web application. My lecture was prepared for the colleagues of mine to discuss
    vulnerabilities from AWASP Top 10 list and topics related to them. Later this lecture inspired one of
